# Citi Bike Demand Analysis

This project explores Citi Bike trip data to better understand how demand varies across time and locations in New York City.

Using historical ride records, the analysis focuses on identifying usage patterns across stations, rider types, and time periods. The goal was to clean and structure the data in a way that can support future demand forecasting and operational planning.

---

## Project Summary

The dataset was processed to examine:

- Peak ride times
- Demand variation by day and hour
- Differences between rider types
- Station-level usage trends

Trips with unrealistic durations were removed and timestamps were standardized to ensure consistency.

Time-based features such as hour, day of week, and month were created to better understand demand behavior.
